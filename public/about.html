<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at GITAM University, Vishakapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, where I’ve maintained a cumulative GPA of 9.42 up to my fourth semester. Prior to this, I completed a Diploma in Civil Engineering from Government Polytechnic College, Srikakulam, with a CGPA of 9.1, and I graduated from Sri Chaitanya School, Srikakulam, securing a perfect CGPA of 10. My educational journey has been one of continuous growth, and I take pride in consistently performing well academically at every stage.</p>

<p>In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in several programming languages such as C, Java, and Python, with web development experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. I have worked on multiple projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge practically, including building an Amazon clone and a YouTube clone. These projects involved implementing features like cart creation, bill generation, and user interface replication. Additionally, I enjoy solving problems on platforms like CodeChef, Codeforces, and LeetCode, where I’ve tackled various challenges related to algorithms and data structures.</p>

<p>Beyond academics and technical expertise, I’m also focused on developing my interpersonal and leadership skills. I currently head the design for a smart QR menu card project, where I’m leading the development and design aspects. This role has allowed me to refine my project management and team collaboration skills. I enjoy working with people from diverse backgrounds and am always open to new challenges, aiming to continuously grow both as a student and as a professional.</p>
